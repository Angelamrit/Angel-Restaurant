            <p className="rise rise-late">In Pathankot, Punjab, Amrit Pal Singh grew up around food and family. His journey took him to culinary training in Australia, then to the kitchens of Rahi and Adda in New York.</p>
            <p className="rise rise-late">In October 2019, he invested his savings in a restaurant of his own in Jackson Heights. He named it Angel, after his young daughter.</p>
            <p className="rise rise-late">The approach has stayed close to home: preserve the true taste of each ingredient. Give it care, rather than hiding it behind excess cream or spice.</p>
