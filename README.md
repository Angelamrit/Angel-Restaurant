# Angel Indian Restaurant

Dynamic menu/admin setup, deployment variables, migration commands and verification are documented in [ADMIN_SETUP.md](./ADMIN_SETUP.md).

Complete restaurant website built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind 4. It includes the homepage, menu, story, experience gallery, private dining, visit, FAQ, and privacy & terms routes.

Before implementing components, read [DESIGN_SPEC.md](./DESIGN_SPEC.md). Restaurant content and unresolved facts are preserved in [CONTENT_REFERENCE.md](./CONTENT_REFERENCE.md). Global tokens and reusable styles live in `app/globals.css`; fonts are configured through `next/font` in `app/layout.tsx`.

Validation: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, then `npx tsc --noEmit`. Google fonts are fetched at build time and self-hosted for visitors. Every future route should provide `main#main-content` for the root skip link. The private-dining form is delivered server-side via a Server Action and Resend (see `app/private-dining/actions.ts`, `lib/enquiry.ts`); it falls back to a prepared email only if delivery fails or `RESEND_API_KEY` is unset. See `.env.example` for required environment variables.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
